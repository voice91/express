# Coding Standard

## Context

Discuss the rules regarding the coding standards for the Node.js application. Modify the instructions accordingly for database-related code.

## Decision

The best coding practices and standards for Node.js development. These are not strict rules but common practices to write clean and consistent code. Adapt these guidelines to database-related code.

Here are some coding practices to follow in a Node.js project, with a focus on database-related code:

1. **Selective Data Retrieval:**
    - Whether using `populate` or not, ensure that you use the `select` feature to fetch and transmit only the required fields from the database in API responses. This practice minimizes unnecessary data transfer and applies to both plain database queries and queries involving `populate`.

2. **Using `Promise.all` for Independent Database Queries:**
    - To enhance efficiency, leverage `Promise.all` when executing multiple independent database queries concurrently within a single operation. This approach optimizes the retrieval of data.

3. **Database Changes via Migration Scripts:**
    - To maintain data integrity and version control, create migration scripts for making changes to the production or staging database. Avoid making direct modifications to the database.

4. **Use of Database Transactions:**
    - Implement database transactions to ensure data consistency and integrity, especially when multiple database operations need to be executed together. Transactions guarantee that all changes are either committed or rolled back as a single unit.

5. **Single Database Query per Model per API:**
    - For clean and efficient code, strive to use only one database query for one model in each API endpoint. Avoid calling the same model's query multiple times within the same API, reducing both complexity and database load.

6. **Indexing for Performance:**
    - Improve query performance by creating appropriate indexes on frequently used database columns. Proper indexing can significantly enhance database operations.

7. **Query Optimization:**
    - Regularly review and optimize database queries. Utilize tools such as query analyzers and profiling to identify and enhance slow-performing queries.

8. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    - Implement monitoring and logging for database queries to track execution times, errors, and overall performance. Monitoring helps identify issues early and ensures data reliability.

9. **Data Validation:**
    - Maintain data integrity by validating data stored in the database. Implement data validation on both the application side and through database constraints.
